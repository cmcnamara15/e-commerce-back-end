This project was an exercise in creating the routes and models for the back end of an e-commerce site. Mimicking on a very basic level the sort of code that is written to run and maintain a platform like shopify. With such a strong prevalence of these platforms in our everyday life, it is important for an aspiring developer to understand their fundamental architecture. With this project I feel like I have done just that.
